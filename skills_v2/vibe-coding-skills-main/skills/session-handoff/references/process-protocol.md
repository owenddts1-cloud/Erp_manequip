# Process Protocol

## 1. Confirm Same-Task Continuation
- Verify that the next window will continue the same unfinished task.
- Verify the current window still has the needed context to summarize itself.

## 2. Collect Current-Session Surfaces
- Find the related plan, memory, experience, and process refs.
- Prefer refs already linked from existing docs over broad repo scanning.

## 3. Draft One Continuation Pack
- Write to `docs/session-handoff/SHO-YYYYMMDD-NNNN.md`.
- Keep it pointer-first and session-scoped.
- If the session spans multiple subtasks, represent them under `Subtask Snapshots`.

## 4. Required Markdown Sections
- `Session ID`
- `Generated At`
- `Offload Reason`
- `Session Goal`
- `Overview`
- `Related Refs`
- `Subtask Snapshots`
- `Avoid Repeat`
- `Next Window Boot`
- `Source of Truth`

## 5. Section Guidance
- `Overview`
  - Summarize what this session actually accomplished and what remains unresolved.
- `Related Refs`
  - Group refs by `plans`, `memory`, `experience`, and `process/evidence`.
  - When an older plan is no longer the current execution entrypoint, label it as `historical` or `reference-only` instead of presenting it as the active task definition.
- `Subtask Snapshots`
  - For each subtask: goal, completed summary, remaining summary, blockers, next action, and evidence refs.
  - If the session invalidated a prior plan direction, say so explicitly and point to the new diagnosis or code anchor.
- `Avoid Repeat`
  - Keep only 1-3 high-signal lessons or anti-patterns.
- `Next Window Boot`
  - State exactly what to read first and what the first action should be.
  - If an older plan should not be continued by default, name it and say so directly.
  - When direct coding would be unsafe, add one concise `Before coding` line that points to the current execution entrypoint or the next planning owner.
  - Keep that line pointer-first. It may say to review an existing plan or create/refresh one, but it must not inline plan content.
- `Source of Truth`
  - State that plan lifecycle truth remains in `docs/plans/`, code facts remain in repository or Git evidence, and the handoff pack is only a continuation layer.

## 6. New-Window Consumption Order
1. Read `Offload Reason` and `Overview`.
2. Read `Subtask Snapshots`.
3. Read related plan refs.
4. Read related memory refs.
5. Read related experience refs and `Avoid Repeat`.
6. Start new planning after the above is understood.

## 7. Resume Entrypoint Guidance
- Omit any extra `Before coding` hint when direct coding is obviously safe and the task is tiny.
- If a current valid execution plan still exists, use a concrete note such as `Before coding: review PLAN-... and confirm it still covers the current execution entrypoint.`
- If no current valid execution entrypoint exists, use a concrete note such as `Before coding: create or refresh the implementation plan in sdd-plan-maintainer.`
- If an older plan is now `historical` or `reference-only`, say so directly rather than inventing an abstract label.
- See `resume-entrypoint-guidance.md` for phrasing patterns and anti-patterns.

## 8. MVP Guardrails
- Explicit trigger only.
- One Markdown pack only.
- No `.json` sidecar.
- No `SESSION_INDEX.json`.
- No automatic write-back to other docs.
