This repository provides reusable skills that improve coding outcomes through:
- planning and lifecycle governance
- deferred-but-binding technical guardrails for long-horizon migrations
- checkpoint validation and bounded remediation gates
- checkpoint commit strategy for large dirty worktrees
- session handoff and context offload
- project memory continuity
- reusable experience capture
- external knowledge verification
- multi-agent discussion setup

## What This Repository Provides

- A SKILL-first repository contract (`skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` is required).
- Deterministic validation and release tooling under `.devtools/`.
- Cross-tool packaging profiles for `codex`, `claude`, `cursor`, `gemini`, and `copilot`.
- A growing skill library for real vibe coding scenarios.

## Skill Catalog

![vibe-coding-skills current skills overview](docs/assets/vibe-coding-skills-banner.png)

See [docs/skills/INDEX.md](docs/skills/INDEX.md) for the current public skill catalog, typical outputs, boundaries, and direct links to each `SKILL.md`.
Each skill's source of truth remains `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`.

## Repository Contract

Each skill lives in `skills/<skill-slug>/`.

Required:
- `SKILL.md`

Optional (recommended when needed):
- `references/`
- `scripts/`
- `agents/` (tool/provider adapters such as `openai.yaml`)
- `assets/`

The `skill-slug` should stay stable after publishing because runtime installers map folder names directly.

Script path convention:
- In skill docs, executable examples for skill-bundled tools should use `<skill-root>/scripts/...`.
- Reserve `--root` or `--repo-root` for the target workspace being operated on.
- Avoid executable examples like `python scripts/...`, which are ambiguous with the caller's current working directory.

Example (single-skill structure):

```text
skills/example-skill/
  SKILL.md
  references/
  scripts/
  agents/
  assets/
```

## Prerequisites

Required:
- `bash`
- `python3`
- `rsync`

Python package:
- `PyYAML` (used by smoke frontmatter validation)

Recommended Python environment management:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install pyyaml
```

Fallback without `uv`:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pyyaml
```

## Validate

Repository structure check:

```bash
./.devtools/check-structure.sh
```

Validate one skill:

```bash
./.devtools/smoke.sh --skill-dir skills/sdd-plan-maintainer
```

Smoke design:
- `.devtools/smoke.sh` is a dispatcher.
- Each skill owns its own smoke entry under `skills/<skill>/scripts/smoke.sh` (or `smoke.py`).

Run skill regression tests when a skill provides functional CLI tests:

```bash
./.devtools/test.sh --skill-dir skills/sdd-plan-maintainer
```

Run all available skill regression tests:

```bash
./.devtools/test.sh --all
```

Test design:
- `.devtools/test.sh` dispatches to `scripts/test.sh`, `scripts/test.py`, or `scripts/tests/` when present.
- Use smoke for contract or structure checks; use tests for behavior regressions.

## Release

Default behavior:
- `release.sh` and `release-all.sh` target `user-level` skill directories unless an explicit runtime path is provided.

Release one skill:

```bash
./.devtools/release.sh --tool codex   --skill-dir skills/sdd-plan-maintainer
./.devtools/release.sh --tool claude  --skill-dir skills/sdd-plan-maintainer
./.devtools/release.sh --tool cursor  --skill-dir skills/sdd-plan-maintainer
./.devtools/release.sh --tool gemini  --skill-dir skills/sdd-plan-maintainer
./.devtools/release.sh --tool copilot --skill-dir skills/sdd-plan-maintainer
```

Release all skills:

```bash
./.devtools/release-all.sh --tool codex
./.devtools/release-all.sh --tool claude
./.devtools/release-all.sh --tool cursor
./.devtools/release-all.sh --tool gemini
./.devtools/release-all.sh --tool copilot
```

Release to a project-level directory by overriding the runtime path:

```bash
./.devtools/release.sh --tool copilot --skill-dir skills/experience-capture --runtime-root /path/to/project/.github/skills/experience-capture
./.devtools/release.sh --tool cursor  --skill-dir skills/experience-capture --runtime-root /path/to/project/.cursor/skills/experience-capture
```

All release operations use a whitelist payload:
- `SKILL.md`
- `agents/**` (if present)
- `references/**` (if present)
- `scripts/**` (if present)
- `assets/**` (if present)

This keeps runtime skill directories clean and avoids shipping repository-only files.

## Compatibility Baseline

- Core contract is SKILL-first (`SKILL.md` is the required source of truth).
- Platform adapter files are optional and isolated under `agents/`.
- See `docs/compatibility/skills-matrix.md` for profile paths and adapter constraints.

## Verified Platforms

Validated in real use:
- `Codex`
- `Claude Code`
- `Gemini CLI`
- `GitHub Copilot`
- `Cursor`

Verified install/load paths:
- `Codex`: personal-level runtime release via `~/.codex/skills/<skill>`
- `Claude Code`: personal-level runtime release via `~/.claude/skills/<skill>`
- `Gemini CLI`: personal-level runtime release via `~/.gemini/skills/<skill>`
- `GitHub Copilot`: project-level `.github/skills/<skill>` and personal-level `~/.copilot/skills/<skill>`
- `Cursor`: project-level `.cursor/skills/<skill>`, project-level `.agents/skills/<skill>`, and personal-level `~/.cursor/skills/<skill>`

Practical note:
- These skills are built around a SKILL-first, tool-agnostic repository contract.
- Even when a platform uses a different discovery path, the reusable source asset remains `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` plus optional `references/`, `scripts/`, `agents/`, and `assets/`.

## Milestones and Roadmap

Current milestone:
- v1 foundation plus phase-1 harness expansion currently ship 11 skills for core vibe coding scenarios.

Next expansion focus:
- Long-running workflow skills: support resumable execution guidance, checkpoint/handoff discipline, and low-loss context continuity for multi-session coding work.
- CI-related skills: support test strategy selection, release gate checks, regression triage guidance, and CI-friendly quality workflows.
- Release/install strategy refinement: add clearer project-level vs user-level publishing support and platform-specific install guidance where needed.

Roadmap principle:
- New skills should stay guidance-first (prior knowledge + workflow patterns + reusable scripts), not business runtime orchestration modules.
