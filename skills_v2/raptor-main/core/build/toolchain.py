"""Toolchain-home env-var auto-detection for build subprocesses.

The sandbox's `get_safe_env()` keeps a tight allowlist that deliberately
excludes language-specific vars like `JAVA_HOME`, `GOROOT`,
`DOTNET_ROOT`, `RUSTUP_HOME`. Expanding the allowlist globally would
broaden exposure for every non-that-language user (prompt-injection
amplification — see PR #210 threat-model notes).

Instead, each build-system entry in
`packages/codeql/build_detector.BUILD_SYSTEMS` declares an
`env_detect: List[str]` naming the vars it needs. At build time, this
module resolves each name by filesystem probing — never by reading
`os.environ` (which would re-admit the operator's shell quirks we're
trying to keep out of the sandbox).

Detection strategy per var:

  JAVA_HOME     1. /usr/lib/jvm/default-java (Debian/Ubuntu symlink)
                2. readlink -f $(which java) → strip /bin/java
                3. /usr/libexec/java_home (macOS — when supported)

  GOROOT        readlink -f $(which go) → strip /bin/go

  DOTNET_ROOT   readlink -f $(which dotnet) → strip /bin

  RUSTUP_HOME   1. ~/.rustup if present
                2. `rustup show home` output (if rustup on PATH)

Helpers return None when nothing resolves. Callers log a WARNING
naming the missing toolchain, then let the build tool surface its
own error (cryptic but authoritative).
